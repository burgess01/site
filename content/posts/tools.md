I am planning on most likely using these two resources: Tensorflow and Pokemon Showdown. Tensorflow is a software I talked about previously on the last post called tutorial, but Pokemon Showdown is something I haven't. I believe that Pokemon Showdown would be very useful to me for multiple reasons. First, as I want to create a machine learning model, I would need to have as large of a testing bank as possible. Since Pokemon Showdown saves the results from many previous battles, I would have a lot of examples to feed into my software. The other reason is that once I have my model created, there are many different real people that I would be able to pit my model against. Pokemon showdown would make it very easy to measure how effective my model was too, as I would be able to judge based on my ladder score how good the AI was at playing against people of different skill levels.
