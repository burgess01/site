I believe that my project is feasible. I have all the hardware I need, though I will likely have to invest in a 50$ SSD card in order to hold my project and that data that I will need. I will be using various libraries and softwares, such as plotly to visualize the results that I will collect from my human testers, webdriver to allow my program to interact with the Pokemon Showdown website I will use to run my project on, and TensorFlow that I will use to assist me in building my website. I will be writing my project in python, as it is the language that I am most familiar with and the one that all my libraries are accessible from. I will need to gather previous battle information from the pokemon showdown website in order to train my model, which I believe will be easy to gather. I believe building this project will take me around 2-3 months with my current level of experience and the way I plan on tackling this project.
