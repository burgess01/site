Machine learning applications for CPU creation in video games, mainly in applications for competitive pokemon. Want to make model to work with Pokemon Showdown, an online website, would be able to get measurable results from a wide range of individuals, ladder rankings could be used to show skill level. In order to add complexity, I think it would be interesting to build multiple different models based on different information searching algorithms in order to see which one performs better. They will be ranked based on their ladder ranking. Not sure whether it would be better to do random battles, as the teams would be randomized for both the computer and the opponent, or if it would be better to use a predetermined team to allow the CPU to get more standardized results to learn off of.
