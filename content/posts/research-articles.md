### Survey Article from the literature


 - Citation of the article

 Shao, Kun, et al. "A survey of deep reinforcement learning in video games." arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.10944 (2019).

 - In two or three sentences, discuss the goals of this article.

 The goals of this article are to discuss some of the different ways artificial intelligence is used in video games. They also discuss the role deep reinforcement learning is used in this area, as well as the challenges that come with it. They talk about the important things to focus on when working with deep reinforcement learning.


 - What is /are the general task(s) that all the methods address in the article?

 All of these methods address the best ways in which you can create a deep reinforcement learning model.


 - What are some of the leading methods introduced and discussed in this paper?

 Some of the leading models covered are:

 policy gradient DRL methods
 value-based DRL methods
 model-based DRL methods


 They also list a very large amount of algorithms that can be used specifically for DRL in video games and what the main technique behind those algorithms are.


 - What is the context of the discussion of these methods? For instance, are there demonstrations in light of some task that they address?

 These topics are being discussed in order to talk about why DRL is effective and all the different options you have when working with DRL in video games.



 - How can some of these methods be used in your own work? What purpose would the method serve in your work?


 I could use these methods in order to build my own model. I could then choose a handful and see which performs best and discuss why I think this might be.

### First article from the literature

 - Citation of the article

 Léandre Lavoie-Hudon, Daniel Lafond, Katherine Labonté, and Sébastien Tremblay. 2021. Cognitive Shadowing for Learning Opponents in a Strategy Game Experiment: Using Machine Learning to Counter Players’ Strategies. Extended Abstracts of the 2021 Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play. Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 308–313. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3450337.3483453


 - What is the goal of this article?

 The goal of this article is to show how a tool called 'Cognitive Shadow' can be used in order to create a machine learning based AI to be an opponent for a game. In a rock/paper/scissors game, when the game was random, the CPU lost a lot. When the machine learning skills were turned on, the CPU won a lot more. When the human player knew that they were playing against an opponent that would learn from what they were previously doing, they said that they felt more engaged with the game. This paper was written to show this point and the capabilities Cognitive Shadow has to fulfil the wants of a human player. They display this with more complex models, showing how complex the machine learning model can be.

 - In about 100 words, please summarize the main goal of the article.

 The main goal of this article is to find out how good of an opponent the Cognitive Shadow machine learning tool can be, and how much it can increase engagement in the players. The researchers discovered that the tool was around %60 accurate, even on guessing games. They also discovered that when the players knew it was a smart tool, they became much more engaged with the game as opposed to if they thought the CPU just chose at random.

### Second article from the literature

 - Citation of the article

 Synnaeve, Gabriel, et al. "Torchcraft: a library for machine learning research on real-time strategy games." arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.00625 (2016).

 - What is the goal of this article?

 The goal of this article is to present a tool they worked on called TorchCraft. It is a library that is supposed to make working with AI in video games, even real time games, much easier.

 - In about 100 words, please summarize the main goal of the article.

 The goal of this article is to explain the TorchCraft library and why it is useful to the user. Their goal was to explain different games it works in, the different functions of the library uses, and why it is better for the user than other softwares.
