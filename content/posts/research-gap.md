I knew my gap existed through going through Google Scholar and looking up the website I wanted to use. Unsurprisingly, the only results that came up were projects that were very similar or almost identical to the idea that I had for my senior project originally (Lee, Scott, and Julian Togelius. "Showdown ai competition." 2017 IEEE ),(Llobet Sanchez, Miquel. Learning complex games through self play-Pokémon battles. BS thesis. Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, 2018.),(Rill-Garcıa, Rodrigo. "Reinforcement Learning for a Turn-Based Small Scale Attrition Game."). 
Due to this, I knew I had to pivot. Out of all the projects that were listed, I only saw one that was somewhat similar, which talked about the intensity of the game (Panumate, Chetprayoon, Shuo Xiong, and Hiroyuki Iida. "An Approach to Quantifying Pokemon's Entertainment Impact with Focus on Battle." 2015 3rd International Conference on Applied Computing and Information Technology/2nd International Conference on Computational Science and Intelligence. IEEE, 2015.). This inspired me to go into my gap and develop my question, as I saw it as something that would definitely be worth exploring.
The idea that I came up with is: "What is the effect of playing against a randomizer vs machine learning model vs other person for those with no experience vs those with a lot?"
I think that it would be interesting to try to see how enjoyable the experience would be for a player at different skill levels play against different AI, as well as an actual person. If they don't know which is which, how will they rank them? I think that it would be very interesting to see what they would think, and if they would be able to tell the difference between a person and an AI.
In order to complete this project,I will try to follow the loose model of:
Building my machine learning model
Creating the randomized model
Finding a testing base + running my tests
Compiling the data and seeing if there is a trend
Write about the trend
